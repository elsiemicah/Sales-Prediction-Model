# Simple Linear Regression Model for Sales Prediction

This repository contains a simple linear regression model implemented in Python to analyze the relationship between TV advertising expenditure and sales. The model is built using the "ISLR" dataset, which is commonly used in statistical learning applications.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the "ISLR" dataset, which includes information on advertising budgets (TV, radio, newspaper) and corresponding sales figures. The dataset can be found in the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R" (ISLR) and is often used for educational purposes.

## Analysis

The main goal of this analysis is to explore the relationship between TV advertising expenditure and sales using a simple linear regression model. The steps involved in the analysis include:

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Visualizatiing the relationship between TV advertising and sales
3. Preparating the data for model training
4. Splitting the data into training and testing sets
5. Building and training the linear regression model
6. Evaluating the model's performance
7. Visualizing of the regression line

## Usage

To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elsiemicah/sales-prediction-linear-regression.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd sales-prediction-linear-regression
```

3. Install the required dependencies (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn):

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

4. Download the "ISLR" dataset (not provided in this repository) and place it in the project directory.

5. Run the Python script `sales_prediction.py`:

```bash
python sales_prediction.py
```
